    <h3>Honostly this page is going to be me giving my opinions on matters that aren't important.</h3>
    <p>I am not going to Zuckerberg people and bully them. I am not that type of person. I am that type of person to bully people that are trying to scam others (that are mainly succeeding). Also a little political stuff, and my future.</p>

        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>So this is going to be me ranting about religion. Honostly though religion is the biggest scam on the face of this planet. It was made for upper clased people to cash in on people that we dumb enough to spend money on them. I hate those people that knock on my door and ask me to go to their church (or whatever type of religion metting place). It disgusts me that people are still milking out the poor for the money so they can go to "heaven" which there is no proven scientific study on. </p>

        <h2>Education System (high school)</h2>
        <p>So lets talk about school. Course I haven't Graduated yet but I think I have read enough articles and got enough lectures of my mother to understand the concept of high school. High School is literally the most important years of your life. If you mess up in high school then you are basically set to not get into any college and have to work at Mc. Donnalds for the rest of your life. I hate this fact. Some people espically unlogical people (sometimes sports athelets) make dumb choices. Unlogical people don't understand that if they fuck up (excuse my language) they are screwed. (Theres ways around if they barely make it through I am not going to spend my time and name them) At least in earily years of high school students don't try hard enough and it kinda fucks them in the ass during their last year of high school. Their Freshmen year is between the ages of 14 and 15. You are giving a 14 year old the ability to screw themselves? I mean I love my school but still. I feel unlogical/moody teenagers will not have the knowledge to succeed and this is not good. Anyways Imma end it here you get the jist of it (they give 14-15 year old's to much responsibility).

        <h2>Politics (North Korea)</h2>
        <p>Honostly come on... You really think you can nuke the U.S? Like your gonna end up dying so fast if you try to do anything to us (U.S.) or our allies. That doesn't make sense. He knows how powerful we are why even bother try to threaten us. I don't get it. If the U.S. wanted to they could literally obliterate your fucking country. That's just so dumb I don't get why North korea try's to scare us, it isn't the cold war again. We have the strongest military in the world (and Russia) you don't make sense why you would try to ruin your own country. I remeber yesterday reading about North Korea Flying a blastic missile over Japan. I don't know why they did that. Tests? ehh it doesn't matter but what does is Donald Trump building dat wall doh.</p>
