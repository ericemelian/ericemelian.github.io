    <h3>Honostly this page is going to be me giving my opinions on matters that aren't important.</h3>
    <p>I am not going to Zuckerberg people and bully them. I am not that type of person. I am that type of person to bully people that are trying to scam others (that are mainly succeeding). Also a little political stuff, and my future.</p>

        <h2>Chrome OS</h2>
        <p>I love google. Google is one of the best companies out their and in my opinion the best search engine. But the school that I go to distributes a laptop that has a Chrome OS on it. And I love to have the privilege to use this computer everyday but I feel I would never buy a chrome book. When I was buying a laptop a couple of days ago I had to answer a survey about my previous computer (chromebook) and I realized that I would never buy one. They have barely and programming apps and you have to download everything off of the chrome store. It's like a kid's toy but for a laptop. It sucks. Why would anyone ever want one? Unless you are on an extremely low-budget you could just buy a windows laptop which gives you so many more options to do whatever you want with it. You could uninstall chrome os and install Linux but that's not the point. Why would google make a dumb OS when there is are huge competition such as Microsoft, Apple, and Linux.</p>

        <h2>News paper</h2>
        <p>Okay I know this is definitely not the best topic to talk about with an orange as a president but I still wanna talk about this. Why are news papers still being made? Like honestly no body reads them expect that small number of old people who do read them. You have the internet now, you literally don't need to go out to the grocery store now (amazon). I feel it's a huge waste of trees and its ruining this planet. I know news papers are in smaller print now (since barely anyone reads them) but I don't understand why the need to waste paper.</p>

        <h2>More North Korea</h2>
        <p>Okay this is gonna be my last conversation (at least until more news happens). Why does Russia wanna be allied with North Korea? North  Korea has this dumb ass dictator and which is going to destroy his own country. Anyways I am not going to drown on about this but it doesn't make sense.</p>
